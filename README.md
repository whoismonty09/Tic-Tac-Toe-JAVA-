# Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA-
This project is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game built using Java. Two players take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 board. The program checks for winning conditions after every move and declares the result as win or draw. It demonstrates Java fundamentals such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and basic object-oriented concepts.
